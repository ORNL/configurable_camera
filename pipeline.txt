______________

This file is used to configure the gstreamer pipeline created by the RTSP server in the application.

It is set up this way so that the application does not need to be recompiled for trivial changes to pipeline settings.

The way the pipeline description is laid out in this text file should encapsulate both an rtsp/raw and an rtsp only pipeline:
 - The pipeline description should span four lines of text.
 - To create a description of the combined rtsp/raw pipeline, the app will read and concatenate all four lines above.
 - To create a description of the rtsp only pipeline, the app will concatenate only the first, third, and fourth lines above; skipping the second.
 - All content related to the raw branch and tee structure should be contained to the second line.
 - Each line except the fourth should end with a "!" and each line except the first should start with a " "
to link it to the next element on the next line.
 - The %s string replacement characters will be used to format in gstreamer capabilities and a bayer2rgb element if needed

The function gst_pipeline_txt_gen, implemented in src/config.c, is responsible for reading this file and any others like it.
